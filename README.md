# ðŸ©¸ Blood Bank Management System â€“ SQL Project

Welcome to the **Blood Bank Management System**, a simple yet effective SQL project designed to manage blood donors, hospital records, and blood request tracking using a structured relational database. This project is built entirely using **MySQL** and demonstrates how databases can help streamline real-world systems.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

This repository contains everything you need to get started with the project, including:

* âœ… SQL script to create and set up the database
* âœ… All necessary tables with relationships and constraints
* âœ… Sample data with 50+ realistic records
* âœ… Common queries to interact with the data

---

## ðŸ§± Database Structure

The system is built on a few key tables:

* **Donors** â€“ Stores donor details like name, age, blood group, contact info, and last donation date.
* **Hospitals** â€“ Contains information about registered hospitals.
* **Requests** â€“ Logs blood requests made by hospitals, including request date, units, and status.
* **BloodInventory** â€“ Maintains the current blood stock levels grouped by blood type.

All tables are connected with proper **foreign key constraints** to ensure data integrity.

## ðŸ§© ER Diagram

The ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram visually explains the structure of the database, including:

* One-to-many relationship between Hospitals and Requests
* One-to-many relationship between Donors and Blood Inventory (if modeled that way)
* Primary and foreign keys clearly defined for relational mapping

---

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

* **Database:** MySQL 8.0
* **Tools:** MySQL Workbench for visualization and query execution
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
